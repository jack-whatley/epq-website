					World War One was one of the most striking examples of Trench Warfare being used in history as it was the first time the great powers of Europe fully utilised Trench Warfare 
					and as stalemate took hold, almost a 1000 kilometers of trenches were dug (Canadian Vet Source). Trench Warfare was both violent and calm as despite periods of action where soldiers would push over their trenches, 
					oftentimes there were long periods of boredom and soldiers spent their time occupying themselves and maintaining their section of the line. 
					Effectively a country wide battle of attrition (Sociology Source, pp. 409).

					To bring some context on World War One as a whole, there were two main sides: the Triple Entente, these were the British, French and Russians (until the Russian withdrawal in 1917); the Triple Alliance, this was made up of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy however Italy refused to fight on their side and instead later joined the war on the side of the Entente powers. Other countries of significance include the Ottoman Empire, on the Alliance side. None of the countries involved had any great experience with Trench Warfare, except Russia who had had it used against them by the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese war a decade earlier.
					<br><br>To explain Trench Warfare in more detail, it is the idea of two sides reaching a stalemate or the need to fortify a position, therefore they either dig into the ground or build a breastwork. A breastwork is effectively a trench that is above ground, made of any material that can be sourced, usually used instead of a dug trench in places where the ground is too water-logged to be used. Moreover over features of prominence include: the dugout, this was a soldiers shelter from anything like the weather to enemy artillery fire and could range in size from a small cutout in the wall of a trench to elaborate underground towns; the fire step, as trenches were mostly too tall to see over soldiers this allowed soldiers to step up to the height of the trench and fire over it (Spartacus Educational).
					<br><br>Moreover all trenches followed a zigzag pattern which would stop explosions and shrapnel and prevent enemy soldiers being able to break into a trench and fire down the line, front line trenches would also be defended by barbed wire. There were also connecting trenches back to reserve trenches which were called communication trenches; these reserve trenches were used to house reserve troops and aid posts, but could also be retreated to in the event of the front line falling (Spartacus Educational).
					<br><br>I will explain, in detail, the use and function of these individual parts and provide relevant information that supports my modelling work of the trenches.
